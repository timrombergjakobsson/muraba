So basically this. In a weak moment of mine not to long ago. 
I told my wife that if she ever would get pregnant I would be solidaric and not drink during the pregnancy.
So then she got pregnant. And ofcourse she wanted me to honour that promise. So what happened then. Initially I regreted my promise. So why is that?!
I mean, at the time I was not drinking a lot. Even so I felt a moment of regret. But I decided to stick with the plan and not drink. So now approaching the end of the pregnancy,
how did I manage?! Well to be honest, soso. I have at times had a drink, but not been drunk. Some friends are impressed and think that I have been loyal. 
Me, I just feel like I quite honestly failed. Now a days I prefer to go running or go the gym before drinking. Even so I had a hard time fulfilling my promise. 
This makes me wonder. I know that I have changed. Now a days I just want be at home, go to the gym, have some nice food. Im happy with this.
