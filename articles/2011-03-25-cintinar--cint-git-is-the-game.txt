title: Cintinar @ Cint, git is the game
date: 25/03/2011

Today was Cintinar at Cint. The purpose is to have different workshops every time about some topic chosen by someone. Today's topic was 
**Git**. I have used it before but today we played around with forking some and I'm ashamed to say that I have only done that once before.
