Today I started my first day of my internship at [Cint.com][id]. Well actually this is technical my second day but I didnt have time to

write about it yesterday so this will have to do. So my first day at **Cint** was somewhat calm. We got our working stations and basically only got 
the instructions to "familiarize" ourselves with the tools. I'm foremost a frontend guy I believe, but I have equal interest in the backend. During this internship I will be working mostly in [Visual Studios][vs]
[vs]: http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/sv-se/products/2010-editions  
with **C#** that is. Me I'm more of a **Ruby** guy, and would prefer to work in [Rails][ror].
[ror]: http://rubyonrails.org/






    c#
    
    if(i == 2){
	    Console.WriteLine(i);
	}
	else {
	    Console.WriteLine(i);
	}
	
    ruby
    
    if (i == 2)
	    puts i
	else
	    puts i
	end
